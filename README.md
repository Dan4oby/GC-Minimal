## GC Minimal Template

This repository uses minimal TeamGC's modpack template for Minecraft 1.12 Forge/[Cleanroom](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/Cleanroom) that features [Groovyscript](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/GroovyScript), autobuilding Modrinth, Curseforge and Prismlauncher packs using [Pakku](https://github.com/juraj-hrivnak/Pakku) and autotesting modpack by launching a headless client in actions using [mc-runtime-test](https://github.com/headlesshq/mc-runtime-test).

You can use this template for your needs but please leave a link to me or to this repository.
